// Add Raspberry Pi code here

Progress:
- Setup Libnfc - Oct 21, 2018
- Got wires from Rigidware, connected Pi, and reconfigured code to work with the new port; Pi now successfully reads the tag and the Android phone - Oct 22, 2018

TODO:
 - Get Pi working with Eduroam
 - Get breadboard and connect Pi with the PN532 on there so its physically stable
